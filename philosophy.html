          Staying healthy does not start, nor does it end in the gym. At Mayfair
          Fitness, we believe that your health is a sum of many parts: Diet,
          lifestyle, physical fitness and especially your attitude. Our
          individualized programs will allow you to accomplish your specific
          goals and needs while working one-on-one with our skilled Exercise
          Physiologist. We can set up the proper program that you need to help
          achieve your goals faster. We monitor your progress and fine tune your
          program to help you work through plateaus and to make more efficient
          use of your time at the gym. During a personal training appointment,
          you can expect to receive helpful feedback on everything from your
          fitness level (by way of fitness testing), to the use of the proper
          form, technique and exercises. With the assistance of our Exercise
          Physiologist you can be on your way to a healthier and more energized
          version of yourself; while improving your overall fitness, balance,
          strength, posture, coordination, flexibility and endurance.
